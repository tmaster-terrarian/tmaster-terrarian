### Hello !!!
I'm bscit! I'm an independent artist and game developer, I enjoy drawing anime girls and going on tangents about hyper-specific coding concepts to my friends.
<br>My main interests lie in game development and art, most of the former will appear here or on [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~bscit).

#### Programming skills:
- command line tools
- game development concepts
- very fast learner, but only if I enjoy the topic &nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;)
- C#, can adjust to almost any .NET environment
- web basics (js & ts)
- GameMaker
- Unity, vaguely
